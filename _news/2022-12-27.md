A new paper has been published in PLoS Genetics in collaboration with my former colleagues at the University of Kent in the Buscaino lab.

### [Stress combined with loss of the _Candida albicans_ SUMO protease Ulp2 triggers selection of aneuploidy via a two-step process](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010576)

The paper explores the balance between genome stability and instability in driving genetic diversity and evolution. 

It highlights how the human fungal pathogen _Candida albicans_ utilizes genome variation to adapt to hostile environments and resist antifungal drugs. 

By identifying the SUMO protease Ulp2 as a key regulator of genome integrity, the study reveals how its deletion enhances genome instability and variation, leading to adaptive segmental aneuploidies under combined stress conditions.
