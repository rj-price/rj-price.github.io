### [Comparative genomics and transcriptomics reveal differences in effector complement and expression between races of _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _lactucae_](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.11.589035)

This study presents the first comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analyses of _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _lactucae_ (Fola), the causative agent of Fusarium wilt disease in lettuce. 

By sequencing the genomes of three race 1 (Fola1) and three race 4 (Fola4) isolates, we were able to identify key differences in effector complements between Fola races, as well as compared to other _F. oxysporum formae speciales_. 

The study also revealed the presence and _in planta_ expression of several SIX genes and other candidate effectors, with significant variations, such as an additional SIX8 copy in Fola4 and transposon-disrupted SIX14 in Fola1.
