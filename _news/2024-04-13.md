### [Comparative genomics and transcriptomics reveal differences in effector complement and expression between races of *Fusarium oxysporum* f.sp. *lactucae*](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.11.589035)

This study presents the first comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analyses of *Fusarium oxysporum* f.sp. *lactucae* (Fola), the causative agent of Fusarium wilt disease in lettuce. 

By sequencing the genomes of three race 1 (Fola1) and three race 4 (Fola4) isolates, we were able to identify key differences in effector complements between Fola races, as well as compared to other *F. oxysporum formae speciales*. 

The study also revealed the presence and *in planta* expression of several SIX genes and other candidate effectors, with significant variations, such as an additional SIX8 copy in Fola4 and transposon-disrupted SIX14 in Fola1.
