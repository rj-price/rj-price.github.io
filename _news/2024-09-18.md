I had the pleasure of hosting Dr Chinedu Charles Nwafor at NIAB during his visit to the UK.

Charles is a lecturer in the Department of Crop Science at the University of Benin, Nigeria.

We discussed our current [Cambridge-Africa ALBORADA Research Fund](https://www.cambridge-africa.cam.ac.uk/initiatives/the-alborada-research-fund/) project and a number of other exciting potential projects on orphan crop species.
