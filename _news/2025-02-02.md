I recently published my first web app, a dashboard for rapid exploratory data analysis and visualisation. 

My aim was to open up data analysis and visualisation for those unfamiliar with R/Python, or those of us just wanting a super quick look at their data.

### If you're interested, the app is [here](https://rj-price-eda-dashboard.streamlit.app/?embed_options=light_theme)

It works best with tabular numerical data like experimental results, genome metrics, and other spreadsheet-friendly datasets, and at the moment, it only works with CSV files.

Let me know if you find it helpful, or if you encounter any bugs!
