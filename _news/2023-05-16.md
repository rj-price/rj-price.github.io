A new paper has been published in PLoS ONE in collaboration with colleagues at NIAB, as well as others in Norway and Italy.

### [Chromosome-scale genome sequence assemblies of the ‘Autumn Bliss’ and ‘Malling Jewel’ cultivars of the highly heterozygous red raspberry (_Rubus idaeus_ L.) derived from long-read Oxford Nanopore sequence data](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0285756)

In this study, I led the assembly of chromosome-scale genome sequences for two red raspberry (_Rubus idaeus_ L.) cultivars. 

We sequenced two varieties, ‘Autumn Bliss’ and ‘Malling Jewel,’ using long-read Oxford Nanopore and Illumina sequencing, generating highly contiguous genome assemblies. 

Our results showed high completeness and advancements in repetitive sequence identification compared to the previously published ‘Anitra’ genome sequence. 

These new genome sequences will be extremely useful for functional genomics, evolutionary studies, and pan-genomics diversity studies, offering a resource for understanding and improving red raspberry traits.
