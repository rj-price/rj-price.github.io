### [Overexpression of Vitis GRF4-GIF1 improves regeneration efficiency in diploid _Fragaria vesca_ Hawaii 4](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4583627/v1)

Our latest research introduces a novel method for accelerating strawberry breeding through genetic manipulation, significantly improving regeneration efficiency. 

By overexpressing a _Vitis vinifera_ GRF4-GIF1 chimera in _Fragaria vesca_ Hawaii 4 transformants, we achieved much better results compared to traditional methods. 

This approach avoids the abnormalities seen with other gene versions, marking a significant step forward in efficient and rapid strawberry cultivation.
