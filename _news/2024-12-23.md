Our new mycoprotein pre-print is now available on Research Square.

### Mutation of the LRG1 Rho-GAP gene is responsible for the hyper branching C-variant phenotype in the Quorn mycoprotein fungus _Fusarium venenatum_ A3/5

Our latest research investigated the cause of undesirable colonial variants (C-variants) that appear during Quorn mycoprotein production. 

Through whole genome sequencing, mutations were identified in an LRG1 ortholog in C-variant isolates, which was not observed in wild-type strains. 

Introducing these LRG1 mutations into wild-type isolates using CRISPR/Cas9 successfully reproduced the C-variant morphology, confirming the gene's role in this trait.
