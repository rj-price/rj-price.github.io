Mycoprotein products like Quorn are derived from biomass of the fungus *Fusarium venenatum.*

The production of Quorn and other mycoprotein products is frequently disrupted by the appearance highly branched fungal variants known as C-variants.

These C-variants can outgrow the production strain, which can negatively affect the product's texture and limit production efficiency. 

I currently lead a collaborative project with Marlow Foods Ltd, the producer of Quorn, to understand the genetics behind these C-variants.

Utilising whole genome sequencing and variant analysis pipelines, transcriptomics, and CRISPR-based deletion and base editing, weâ€™re attempting to identify candidate genes responsible for the C-variant phenotype in strains isolated from commercial mycoprotein production runs.

Our overall aim is to provide fundamental insight into which genes are involved in hyphal branching in *Fusarium venenatum* to aid the rational design of new strains of mycoprotein, with the potential to make mycoprotein production even more efficient and sustainable.
