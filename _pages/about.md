Hi! I'm Jordan ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a molecular biologist turned bioinformatician.
- I am currently a junior group leader at NIAB in Cambridge, UK.
- My research focusses on functional genomics and biotechnology of fungi important for food, viticulture and agriculture.
- I use a combination of molecular and computational approaches to understand the links between genome evolution and biological traits.
- I also dabble in plant genomics.

Currently learning:
- Nextflow pipeline development
- Running local LLMs with RAG
